Java and C++ are hugely used by programmers to code for competitive programming. Both have their plus and minus.
In Java , I personally feel that it is easy to code . One does'nt have to worry about pointers while writing code as java has no concept of pointers.
This makes implementation of linkedlist, trees, stack, queues easier than when implemented in C++ .
The best feature of java is that it is platform independent and that is not the same about C++. 
This is a feature of great importance .
Both Java and C++ are object oriented programming languages. 
One disadvantage of Java is that it is slower than C++. C++ is faster than Java. 
Both languages are used in software development purposes.
