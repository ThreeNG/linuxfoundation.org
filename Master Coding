Coding can be challenging in the beginning.
With a different way or syntax of writing about a particular task , it often becomes confusing as to how one should start.
It is important to understand that jumping to bigger algorithms and harder data structures straight way should notbe the motive.
Rather one should focus on getting the basics right.
Simple structures like if-else , switch statements , loops, arrays , strings and writing simple functions with clear understanding of why and how it is wriiten should be one's priority. 
Once these are done you can begin with easier data structures like linkedlist , stacks , queues and then with trees , tries , hashmaps and graphs. 
Algorithms and data structure are the most important and should be done properly. Language can be any, it hardly matters but logic does.
But as the best practices are most people code in C++ and Java.
After doing with basics , practice on platforms like Hackerrank, Hackerearth, Codechef and Leetcode is important.
Hope that it helps !!
