It is simply OK to be cluless and ignorant sometimes, but what is important is to remember that you will be loved and appreciated for what you are.
And that you should start this by loving yourself , understanding your worth. It is not necessary that you find it in one go or very soon.
Sometimes it does take time and it is completely normal . Explore and find what interests you , what you love doing. 
It might not be something that most people do but let it be cause that is what makes you different. 
Embrace yourself , your worth. Never lose hope and work very hard for whatever you love doing . 
You will definitely achieve success sooner or later.
Have patience and know your worth.
